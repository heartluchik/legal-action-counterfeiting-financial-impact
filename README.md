# Thesis project: Legal action vs. counterfeiting (fashion)

This repo contains the datasets (raw → cleaned) and the R code I used in my thesis on the financial impact of legal action against counterfeiting in the fashion industry.

## Tools used
- Excel (text-heavy filtering + manual brand/company mapping)
- R / RStudio (data modeling and analysis)

## What’s inside
- Excel files showing each main data filtering step (2019–2023, terminated cases, fashion brands, brand to company mapping, final company sample)
- Model-ready datasets (for regression / panel / event study)
- R scripts for analysis

## How to navigate
Start in `data/` and follow the numbered files in order.
